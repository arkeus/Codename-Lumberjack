Codename Lumberjack is a simple flash game written using Actionscript 3.0 and Flixel.

Codename Lumberjack is being written as a way to delve into the world of FlashBuilder and GitHub, as I've never touched either of those before now. However, it can also provide as a tutorial to help new users of Flixel learn the reins to creating an adventure platformer.

In the end it might become something more than a learning project with a codename, but we'll have to see. :)
